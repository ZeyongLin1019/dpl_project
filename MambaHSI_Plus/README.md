## MambaHSI+: Multidirectional State Propagation for Efficient Hyperspectral Image Classification [**--PDF--**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023867)

---

### 📘 Overview

**MambaHSI_Plus** is the **V2 version** of our previous **MambaHSI+** framework.  
This version **simplifies** the V1 architecture and achieves **better classification accuracy** and **higher computational efficiency**.

---

### 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ **Simplified architecture:** cleaner, faster, and more efficient than V1  
- 🔁 **Multidirectional state propagation:** enhances spatial–spectral dependency modeling  
- ⚡ **Improved classification accuracy and efficiency**  
- 🧠 **Implemented with:** `mamba-ssm==2.2.2`
